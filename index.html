                                <h2>Ireland</h2>
                                <p>In May 2013, my wife and I decided to take a trip to Ireland. We have ancestry from this beautiful country and had always wanted to vist and take in the sites and sounds. Once there we rented a Ford Focus and trekked the narrow country roads, visiting many places, meeting wonderful people and enjoying delicious food along the way.</p>

                                    <h2>County Clare, IE</h2>
                                    <p>One of the stops my wife and I made was to County Clare. There are a number of places to visit in Clare, the Cliffs of Moher is a staple and a must see. Here's a snippet on the history of the Cliffs (from Wikipedia); The Cliffs of Moher are located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland. They rise 120 metres (390 ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head, and, eight kilometres to the north, reach their maximum height of 214 metres (702 ft) just north of O'Brien's Tower, which is a round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs that was built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien. From the cliffs, and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank amongst the most visited tourist sites in Ireland and receive approximately one million visitors a year. The closest settlements are Liscannor (6 km south) and Doolin (7 km north).</p>

                                        <h2>County Cork, IE</h2>
                                        <p>Driving along the narrow windy roads of Ireland we stopped in County Cork, amongst the places to see there, we stopped at another staple of Ireland, the Blarney Castle. Here's a snippet on the history of Blarney Castle (from Wikipedia); The Blarney Castle is a medieval stronghold in Blarney, near Cork, Ireland, and the River Martin. Though earlier fortifications were built on the same spot, the current keep was built by the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, a cadet branch of the Kings of Desmond, and dates from 1446. The Blarney Stone is among the machicolations of the castle.</p>

                                            <h2>County Meath, IE</h2>
                                            <p>County Meath, outside of Dublin is home to Newgrange and the Knowth tombs. This place was once home to an ancient civilization, here's a snippet of info on Knowth (from Wikipedia); The Knowth Tombs is a Neolithic passage grave and an ancient monument of the World Heritage Site of Brú na Bóinne located 8.4 km west of Drogheda in Ireland's valley of the River Boyne. It is the largest passage grave of the Brú na Bóinne complex and consists of a large mound (known as Site 1) and 17 smaller satellite tombs. The mound is about 12 metres (40 ft) high and 67 metres (220 ft) in diameter, covering roughly a hectare. It contains two passages placed along an east-west line and is encircled by 127 kerbstones, of which three are missing, and four badly damaged.</p>

                                                <h2>County Kerry, IE</h2>
                                                <p>County Kerry was one of my favorite places to stay. Driving the outer edge of Kerry in a complete loop is called the Ring of Kerry. There is a host of places to visit on the drive, one of the places we stopped at was the Gap of Dunloe. Here's a snippet of info on the Gap of Dunloe (from Wikipedia); The pass is located between MacGillycuddy's Reeks (west) and Purple Mountain (east) in County Kerry, Ireland. It is about 11 km (6.8 mi) from north to south. Within it are five lakes: Coosaun Lough, Black Lake, Cushnavally Lake, Auger Lake, and Black Lough (north to south). These lakes are connected by the River Loe. Between the first two lakes is an old arch bridge called the 'Wishing Bridge' so named because it is said that wishes made while upon it are destined to come true.</p>

                                                    <h2>County Kilkenny, IE</h2>
                                                    <p>County Kilkenny is located in the south east area of Ireland. During a shopping trip in the city of Kilkenny we visited Kilkenny Castle, here's a snippet of history on Kilkenny Castle (from Wikipedia); Kilkenny Castle is a castle in Kilkenny, Ireland built in 1195 to control a fording-point of the River Nore and the junction of several routeways. It was a symbol of Norman occupation and in its original thirteenth-century condition it would have formed an important element of the defences of the town with four large circular corner towers and a massive ditch, part of which can still be seen today on the Parade.</p>

                                                        <p>The last stop on our adventure was the City of Dublin, the capital of Ireland. So many places to see during our stay in Dublin. We saw the Trinity Library and the Book of Kells, shopped, went the Guinness Brewery and Jameson Distillery and took a cruise on the River Liffey.</p>
